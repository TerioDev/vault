          <p>><b> * Disclaimer *</b></p> 

          <p>> This song is not finished and probably will never be. </p>
            
          <p>> I started writing this just after Zofia passed away. A lot was happening in my head, but I didn't know how to express it. I wanted to create an way to express everything and instead of disarranged words show a true work of passion to show my investment.</p>

          <p>> The problem is, even tough I commited so much time to it - I disliked it. I don't know why that is, maybe it's that I think what I made doesn't live up to importance of the matter. I was coming back to it time and again for months. I was never satisfied with any outcome I got working on this project tough.</p>

          <p>> With time, my dislike turned into hatred. I started to be frustrated by it. I believed I can do something good, I thought I learned so much and I just need to put it to use. After some time, that faith and fun I found in music evaporated from me.</p>

          <p>> I feel abandoned. Alone with my emotions. Like I proved myself to be a failure. I tried my best to be optimistic, but honestly, I feel cut off. Other people moved on from me, they do and release their own stuff.</p>

          <p>> Now that I'm writing this, I think the best course of action is for me to move on too. I need to live. This song was supposed to be freeing, but it did the opposite to me. Maybe the best way to commemorate death is to do your best to live life to the fullest.</p>
